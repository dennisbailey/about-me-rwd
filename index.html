  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>I'm an amateur human being working my way up to the big leagues. Practicing <strong>empathy</strong>, embracing <strong>curiosity</strong>, and looking for <strong>humor</strong> is how I navigate my days.</p>
  
  <p>I'm always improving old skills while I learn new ones. I don't pass up a chance to learn something new or to share something useful.</p>
  
  <p>I love to be exposed to new ideas and different experiences. I devour a steady stream of writing, podcasts, and tweets to experience the consistent serendipity of the Internet.</p>
    
  <p>Workwise, I'm the <strong>Business Manager</strong> for <a href="www.JOURNEYoga.com">JOURNEYoga</a>. I take care of pretty much everything that isn't teaching. It's an amazing community of people that I'm honored to work with.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  
  <h3>What's Important to me</h3>
  
  <p>There are three traits that are important to me.</p>  

  <ul>
    <li>Empathy</li>
    <li>Practicality</li>
    <li>The ability to change my mind</li>
  </ul>
        
  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  
  <p>I love a good walk. I enjoy listening to podcasts. I'm a sucker for a good campfire.</p>
  
  <h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
 
  <p>There are two things that make a job compelling for me.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Interesting problems that I can help solve</li>
    <li>Interesting people I can learn from and work with</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>One of these is enough to make a job interesting. Both are ideal.</p>
  
  <h3>What Sticks With Me</h3>
  
  <p>I read this years ago and I think about it often.</p>
    
  <blockquote class="more-quote">To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.</blockquote>
  
  <p>It's often attributed to Ralph Waldo Emmerson, but nobody really knows who wrote it.</p>
  
  <h3>What I'm Doing Here</h3>
  
  <p>I'm working my way through the <a href="www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> Frontend Web Development course. This is my third project and my first attempt at <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive web design</a>.
